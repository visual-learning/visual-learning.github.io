            <h2>Homework 1: Object Classification with PyTorch</h2>
            <div class="col-md-12">
                <p> This homework is due on <b>March 8, 2021</b>. You will learn to train multi-label image classification models using the <a href="https://pytorch.org/">Pytorch</a> framework. We will classify images from the <a href="https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist">FashionMNIST</a> and <a href="http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2007/">PASCAL 2007</a> datasets into the object(s) present in the image.</p>

                <br>
                <p> <b>Instructions:</b> </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Starter code and full assignment can be found in this <a href="https://github.com/visual-learning/hw1">repo</a> </li>
                    <li> Please submit your solutions using the class Gradescope. </li>
                    <li> Your hand-in should consist of two parts: 1) a single PDF report (print-out from Jupyter is fine) and 2) all your code in a compressed zip file. Please name the report "AndrewID.pdf" and the code "AndrewID.zip". </li>
                    <li> You should follow the code structure we defined in the steps of this assignment, but small deviation is allowed. </li>
                    <li> It is okay to ask Google for help, but it is not okay to plagarize. Feel free to search “how to add cross entropy loss in pytorch,” but do <b>not</b> steal code from online repos. We are familiar with online tutorial code just so you know.... </li>
                    <li> <b>Late Days:</b> Everyone has 7 non-penalty late days for the whole semester, which are tracked by Gradescope. After 7 days are used up, any assignment handed in late will be graded as <b>0</b> points.</li>
                    <li> <b>Start early.... please!</b></li>
                    <li> <b> Required:</b> Have fun &#128540;</li>
                </ul>
                
                <br>
                <p> <b> Acknowledgements:</b> This assignment was adapted from previous homework written by <a href="https://judyye.github.io/">Yufei Ye</a>, who in turn took code from the PyTorch tutorial. Many thanks to the original authors!</p>
