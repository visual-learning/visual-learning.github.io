            <h2>Homework 4: Visual Question Answering with PyTorch </h2>
            <div class="col-md-12">
                <p> This homework is due on <b>11:59 PM EST April 20, 2022</b>. We will look at the Visual Question Answering task in this assignment. </p>

                <br>
                <p> <b>Instructions:</b> </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Starter code and full assignment can be found <a href="https://github.com/visual-learning/hw4">here</a>. </li>
                    <li> Please submit your solutions on Gradescope. </li>
                    <li> Your hand-in should consist of two parts: 1) a single PDF report and 2) all your code in a compressed zip file. Please name the report "AndrewID.pdf" and the code "AndrewID.zip". </li>
                    <li> You should follow the code structure we defined in the steps of this assignment, but small deviation is allowed. </li>
                    <li> It is okay to ask Google for help, but it is not okay to plagiarize. Feel free to search “how to add cross entropy loss in pytorch,” but do <b>not</b> copy and paste the code from online repositories. </li>
                    <li> The solution will be graded by the final result as well as the correctness of the code. You will get partial credits even if the final result is not perfect.
                    <li> <b>Late Days:</b> Each student has 5 late days for the whole semester, tracked by Gradescope. Each additional late day will incur a 10% penalty on that homework.</li>
                    <li> <b>Start early!</b> This assignment will be slightly more challenging than the last one. So do start early.</li>
                </ul>
